# Breast Cancer Decision Tree and Artificial Neural Network
### Data Mining and Predictive Analysis

#### Problem Description:
Breast cancer is a type of cancer that originates in the breast. The cells are known to grow to form tumors/lumps. It is necessary to understand that tumors in the breast are malignant and benign. As we all know, many tumors all over the world are benign [1]. However, among other cancers, this cancer is the main cause of death. \
The record of breast cancer in Indonesia in 2018 was 16.7% or 58,256. It was pointed out that 30.9% of new cases of breast cancer [2]. In addition, the death rate of this cancer has reached 17 per 100,000 population [3]. \
This cancer requires treatment and examination to check the condition of the tumor. According to the Ministry of Health, the examination can be performed in two ways, namely: self-breast examination (SADARI) that can be performed at home and clinical breast examination (SADANIS) that can be performed by a doctor. \
In this analysis, I want to conduct an analysis to predict the existence of breast cancer category variables (benign or malignant), the purpose is to make people, especially people in Indonesia, be more cautious and aware of breast cancer that may cause death.

#### Data Description:
Sample size of observation: 699 samples. \
The data has 11 variables, including 1 character variable (Ientifier), 9 predictor variables in cell form (𝑥) and 1 response variable (𝑦).

#### Analysis:

> Neural Network
