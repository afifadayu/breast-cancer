# DECISION TREE AND NEURAL NETWORK ANALYSIS

## Modelling and Predicting
1. Import the data
```R
cancerData<-read.csv(file.choose())
head(cancerData)
summary(cancerData)
```
2. Clean the dataset
> Completing missing data
> Calling the library
> Delete Variable 
> Encoding Categorical Data
> Data Visualization
> Data Normalization (Only for Neural Network)
> Check Variable Type
> Create Train and Test Set

3. Build the model

4. Build the prediction model

5. Measure Performance (Only for Neural Network)

6. Tune the hyper-parameter (Only for Neural Network)
